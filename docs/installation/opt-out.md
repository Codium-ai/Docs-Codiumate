# Opt Out of Data Training

Paying users, in Teams and Enterprise plans, are opt-ed out from CodiumAI's model training.
Free users have the option to request for opt-out.

You can do it by sending an email to [support@codium.ai](mailto:support@codium.ai) with subject line "Opt-out from data training". Please provide your name and email address used to login. Our support team will review your request and update your account.

#### New! OptOut direcly from our JetBrains plugin

In order to opt out directly from our JetBrains plugin without emailing support, simply go to Plugin Settings and toggle the `Opt out of sharing my data with Codium AI` switch to on. This will opt you out immediately.

!!! note "Please Notice"

    Currently supported only on JetBrains, coming soon for VSCode.
