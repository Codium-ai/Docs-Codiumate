# Opt Out of Data Training

Paying users, in Teams and Enterprise plans, are opt-ed out from CodiumAI's model training.
Free users have the option to request for opt-out.

We've made a change to allow users to opt in and out of data training on their own within the user portal.

In order to opt out:

1. Log in to https://app.codium.ai/.
2. Go to Account Settings.
3. Toggle the "data utilization" switch off.

#### :material-new-box: OptOut direcly from our JetBrains plugin

In order to opt out directly from our JetBrains plugin without emailing support, simply go to Plugin Settings and toggle the `Opt out of sharing my data with Codium AI` switch to on. This will opt you out immediately.
