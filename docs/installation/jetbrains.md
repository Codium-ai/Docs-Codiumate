# JetBrains IDEs

## Getting Started

2. [Login to Codiumate](./login.md).

3. Start using the plugin ðŸ¥³.


### Android Studio support JCEF

Codiumate Plugin uses JCEF (Java Chromium Embedded Framework) to create a webview component in the plugin's tool window.

By default, most IntelliJ-based IDEs come with a boot runtime that includes JCEF.

However, Android Studio and some older versions of IntelliJ-based IDEs utilize a boot runtime lacking JCEF, which prevents the plugin from loading in these environments.

To address this issue, navigate to the ["Choose Boot Runtime for the IDE" dialog](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/switching-boot-jdk.html). Here, you can select a boot runtime equipped with JCEF.
