# Free Chat Mode

## Overview
Free Chat Mode in Codiumate allows you to engage in conversations about coding-related topics without tying the discussion to specific code files or changesets. This mode is ideal for general coding questions, advice, brainstorming sessions, or any coding-related inquiry where your code doesn't serve as the context.

## Features

- **General Coding Assistance**: Ask any coding-related questions, whether it's about algorithms, best practices, language-specific queries, or debugging techniques.
- **Code Generation**: Request code snippets or examples for understanding concepts or solving generic problems.
- **Continued Conversations**: Each message has the option to "continue this chat," enabling a [threaded](../threads.md) conversation with history for deeper exploration of topics.

## LLM Model
- Free users have access to GPT-3.5.
- Teams and Enterprise users have access to GPT-4.

## How to Use Free Chat Mode

1. **Access Free Chat Mode**: In the "Mode" drop-down, select Free Chat Mode to start a non-contextual coding conversation.
2. **Pose Your Question or Request**: Simply type in your coding-related question or request. It can range from seeking explanations on programming concepts to asking for code examples.
3. **Continue the Conversation**: To delve deeper into the topic, click "continue this chat" on any response. This action initiates a [thread](../threads.md) where you can follow up with more questions or clarify your query, maintaining the history of the conversation.
4. **Switch Modes If Needed**: If your question evolves to require specific code context, you can easily switch to File Mode or Workspace Mode to provide Codiumate with the necessary context for more tailored assistance.

## Use Cases

- **Understanding New Concepts**: When learning new programming languages or frameworks, ask about specific syntax, functionalities, or best practices.
- **General Coding Advice**: Seek advice on code optimization, design patterns, or architectural decisions without needing to reference specific code from your project.
- **Code Snippets Generation**: Request examples or snippets to understand how to implement a function or feature in your work.
