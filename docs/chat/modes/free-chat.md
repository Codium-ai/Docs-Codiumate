# :fontawesome-solid-comment-dots: Free Chat Mode

<h2>Overview</h2>
Free Chat Mode in Codiumate allows you to engage in conversations about coding-related topics without tying the discussion to specific code files or changesets. This mode is ideal for general coding questions, advice, brainstorming sessions, or any coding-related inquiry where your code doesn't serve as the context.

<h2>Features</h2>

- **General Coding Assistance**: Ask any coding-related questions, whether it's about algorithms, best practices, language-specific queries, or debugging techniques.
- **Code Generation**: Request code snippets or examples for understanding concepts or solving generic problems.
- **Continued Conversations**: Each message has the option to "continue this chat," enabling a [threaded](../threads.md) conversation with history for deeper exploration of topics.

<h2>LLM Model</h2>
- Free users have access to GPT-3.5.
- Teams and Enterprise users have access to GPT-4.

<h2>How to Use Free Chat Mode</h2>

1. **Access Free Chat Mode**: In the "Mode" drop-down, select Free Chat Mode to start a non-contextual coding conversation.
2. **Pose Your Question or Request**: Simply type in your coding-related question or request. It can range from seeking explanations on programming concepts to asking for code examples.
3. **Continue the Conversation**: To delve deeper into the topic, click "continue this chat" on any response. This action initiates a [thread](../threads.md) where you can follow up with more questions or clarify your query, maintaining the history of the conversation.
4. **Switch Modes If Needed**: If your question evolves to require specific code context, you can easily switch to File Mode or Workspace Mode to provide Codiumate with the necessary context for more tailored assistance.

    You can now paste an image to the chat box, and ask for any request regarding the image. This feature is using GPT-4 model, and is available for our Teams and Enterprise users only. [Learn more about Image Integration in Codiumate Chat](../images.md).

<h2>Use Cases</h2>

- **Understanding New Concepts**: When learning new programming languages or frameworks, ask about specific syntax, functionalities, or best practices.
- **General Coding Advice**: Seek advice on code optimization, design patterns, or architectural decisions without needing to reference specific code from your project.
- **Code Snippets Generation**: Request examples or snippets to understand how to implement a function or feature in your work.
