# :fontawesome-solid-user-secret: Coding-Agent Mode

## Overview

Coding Agent Mode harnesses the power of Codiumate's AI to offer unparalleled support in your coding journey, transforming your development workflow with intelligent, real-time assistance. This mode focuses on enhancing your coding efficiency and quality by generating detailed plans for your coding tasks and guiding you through their implementation.

## Key Feature: Start a New Task

The centerpiece of Coding Agent Mode is the ability to generate a task implementation plan. By selecting "Start a new task," you're prompted to describe the coding task you wish to accomplish. Codiumate's AI then crafts a detailed plan, outlining the steps necessary to complete your task. This plan serves as a roadmap, guiding you through the coding process with precision and efficiency.

## Countinous Code Improvement: /improve and /issues

While Coding Agent Mode emphasizes task planning and implementation, it seamlessly integrates with Codiumate's automatic commands, `/improve` and `/issues`, which are available across all modes. These commands run automatically in the background, ensuring that your code is constantly being refined and improved.
