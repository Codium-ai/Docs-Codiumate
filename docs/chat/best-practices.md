# :fontawesome-solid-list-check: Best Practices

**Best Practices** helps your team follow coding guidelines effortlessly by integrating them into Qodo Gen's suggestions. Use this feature to enforce consistency and quality across your project.

## The `best_practices.md` File

Qodo Gen automatically reads a `best_practices.md` file located at the root of your project directory. This file should contain guidelines and standards that your team should follow when coding.

**File Size Limit:** The best_practices.md file can contain up to 1,500 lines. If the file exceeds this limit, Qodo Gen will ignore any lines beyond the threshold.
