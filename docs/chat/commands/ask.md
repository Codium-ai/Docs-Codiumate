# `/ask` 

<h2>Description</h2>
Ask open questions about your code, useful to get a better understanding of the code and asking very detailed questions.

<h2>How to Use</h2>
To use the `/ask` command, follow these steps:

1. **Select Your Mode**: First, determine the context in which you need assistance. Codiumate supports two main modes for this command:
    - **File Mode**: For queries related to a specific file, focusing on selected code, changes within the code, or selected components.
    - **Workspace Mode**: For queries concerning a changeset, including committed changes, local changes etc.

2. **Select Your Focus**: After choosing your mode, select the specific code or changeset you want to inquire about. This step ensures Codiumate provides targeted advice and information relevant to your current focus.

3. **Initiate the Command**: Type `/ask` followed by your question in the chat interface. Codiumate will process your query and return a response tailored to the context of your selected mode and focus.

4. **Continue the Chat**: If you require further assistance or have additional questions, click the "continue this chat" button. This action creates a [thread](../threads.md), allowing for a more in-depth conversation regarding your query.

<h3>File Mode Examples</h3>

!!! example "Objective Clarification"
    - **User:** Selects File X local changes
    - **Command:** `/ask What is the primary goal of the changes introduced in file X?`
    - **Codiumate Response:** The primary goal of the changes in file X is to improve data validation, ensuring more accurate input handling and reducing potential errors.

!!! example "Suspicious behavior analysis"
    - **User:** Selects code snippet
    - **Command**: `/ask Why is this function returning an unexpected value?`
    - **Codiumate Response**: Codiumate analyzes the selected code and provides a detailed explanation, potential reasons for the issue, and suggested fixes.

!!! example "Code Logic Explanation"
    - **User:** Selects function Z component
    - **Command:** `/ask I'm unclear about the function logic Z. Could you explain the flow and expected outcomes?`
    - **Codiumate Response:** Function Z manages user authentication. It first checks for existing sessions and proceeds to validate credentials if no session is present. The expected outcome is a secure and streamlined authentication process.

!!! example "Security Measures Inquiry"
    - **User:** Selects authentication file code snippet
    - **Command:** `/ask What security measures have been taken into account for the updated authentication process?`
    - **Codiumate Response:** The updated authentication process includes enhanced encryption protocols and additional checks to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection. It undergoes regular security audits.

<h3>Workspace Mode Examples</h3>

!!! example "Library Usage Explanation"
    - **User:** Selects committed changes from current branch with target branch `main`
    - **Command:** `/ask Can you provide more context on the decision behind using library Y in this PR?`
    - **Codiumate Response:** Library Y was chosen for its efficiency in handling asynchronous tasks, enhancing the responsiveness of our application. Its robust community support also influenced the decision.

!!! example "Performance Consideration"
    - **User:** Selects committed changes from current branch with target branch `main`
    - **Command:** `/ask Are there any potential performance implications of the modifications in this pull request?`
    - **Codiumate Response:** The modifications might lead to a slight performance improvement, especially in database queries. Extensive testing has been conducted to ensure overall system efficiency.

!!! example "Architecture Alignment"
    - **User:** Selects local changes
    - **Command:** `/ask How do the changes in this changeset align with the overall architecture of the project?`
    - **Codiumate Response:** The changes adhere to the microservices architecture, enhancing modularity. The new components seamlessly integrate with existing services, maintaining overall system coherence.

!!! example "Testing Strategy Inquiry"
    - **User:** Selects committed changes from current branch with target branch `main`
    - **Command:** `/ask Could you elaborate on the testing strategy employed for the new features introduced in this pull request?`
    - **Codiumate Response:** A combination of unit tests and integration tests has been employed to validate the functionality. Mock data and edge cases are extensively covered to ensure robust performance.

!!! example "Configuration Changes Clarification"
    - **User:** Selects staged changes
    - **Command:** `/ask I noticed changes in the configuration file. What considerations were made regarding backward compatibility?`
    - **Codiumate Response:** Backward compatibility is a priority. Configuration changes include deprecation notices for outdated settings, and existing configurations are automatically migrated to the new structure.

!!! example "Code Style Guidelines"
    - **User:** Selects staged changes
    - **Command:** `/ask Are there any specific code style guidelines or conventions followed in these changes?`
    - **Codiumate Response:** Yes, It follows the editorâ€™s coding style config. Indentation is with spaces, and we use camelCase for variable names. Consistency with existing code is maintained throughout the changes.

!!! example "Algorithm Choice Explanation"
    - **User:** Selects committed changes from current branch with target branch `main`
    - **Command:** `/ask Is there a specific reason for choosing algorithm A over algorithm B for the functionality introduced in this PR?`
    - **Codiumate Response:** Algorithm A was chosen for its lower time complexity in our specific use case. Extensive benchmarking showed it outperforms Algorithm B, especially as the dataset scales.
