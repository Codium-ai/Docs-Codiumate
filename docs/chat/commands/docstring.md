# `/docstring`

##Description
Automatically generate or improve docstrings for your code, enhancing documentation quality and maintainability. The `/docstring` command is designed to aid in creating comprehensive, clear, and consistent docstrings for functions, classes, and modules, following best documentation practices.

##How to Use
To use the `/docstring` command, follow these steps:

1. **Select Your Mode**: Choose the appropriate context for adding or improving docstrings. Codiumate supports this command in two modes:
    - **Current File Focus**: For generating or refining docstrings within a specific file, focusing on individual functions, classes, or entire files.
    - **Git-Diff Focus**: For a broader approach, encompassing multiple files within your changeset to ensure consistent documentation across your project.

2. **Select Your Focus**: Identify the code segment or entire file for which you wish to generate or enhance the docstring. 

3. **Initiate the Command**: Type `/docstring` followed by an optional specific instruction or leave it blank for general docstring generation. Codiumate will analyze the selected code and generate a suitable docstring or suggest improvements to existing documentation.

4. **Review and Apply**: Evaluate the suggested docstring provided by Codiumate. You can directly apply the changes with a single click or edit the suggestion to better fit your requirements before applying.
