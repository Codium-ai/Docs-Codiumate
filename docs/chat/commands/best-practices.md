# `/generate-best-practices` 

## Description

**Best Practices** helps your team follow coding guidelines by integrating them into Qodo Gen's suggestions. Use this feature to enforce consistency and quality across your project.

Use the `/generate-best-practices` command to generate a `best_practices.md` file. This is a generic file automatically generated by Qodo Gen. You can modify or completely replace it to include the specific guidelines you want your team to follow.

## How to Use
To use the `/generate-best-practices` command, follow these steps:

1. **Select Your Focus**: Before using this command, set a Focus. While the Focus does not influence the content of the generated `best_practices.md` file, Qodo Gen requires a Focus to be set in order to execute any command.

2. **Initiate the Command**: Type `/best-practices` in the chat interface. Qodo Gen will process your request and generate coding best practices and guidelines.

3. **Copy the Response as Markdown**: Click the three dots button in the top-right corner of Qodo Gen's response message, and select `Copy message as markdown`. Paste the markdown content into a new file named `best_practices.md`.

4. **Customize `best_practices.md`**: Modify the content of `best_practices.md` as needed. You can add new best practices, modify existing ones, or remove parts to better suit your team's requirements. You can also ask Qodo Gen Chat to do that for you!

## The `best_practices.md` File

Qodo Gen automatically reads a `best_practices.md` file located at the root of your project directory. This file should contain guidelines and standards that your team should follow when coding.

### File Size Limit:

* The best_practices.md file can contain up to 1,500 lines.
* If the file exceeds this limit, Qodo Gen will process only the first 1,500 lines and ignore the rest.

    # Qodo Gen Best Practices

    ## General Code Structure

    - **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive and consistent naming for variables, functions, and classes. For example, use camelCase for variables and functions, and PascalCase for class names.

    - **Documentation and Comments**: Ensure all functions, classes, and modules have comprehensive docstrings. Use the `/docstring` command to generate or improve documentation.

    - **Code Modularity**: Break down large functions into smaller, reusable components. This enhances readability and maintainability.

    ## YAML Configuration

    - **Navigation Structure**: Organize navigation in YAML files using nested lists for hierarchical structures. Ensure each section is clearly defined and logically grouped.

      ```yaml
      nav: 
        - 'index.md'
        - Installation:
          - 'installation/index.md'
          - 'installation/vscode.md'
      ```

    - **Theme Customization**: Define custom themes and palettes in the YAML configuration to maintain a consistent look and feel across the documentation.

      ```yaml
      theme:
        name: material
        palette:
          - media: "(prefers-color-scheme: light)"
            scheme: default
      ```

    ## Markdown and Documentation

    - **Use of Admonitions**: Utilize admonitions for highlighting important information, such as tips, warnings, and examples. Use custom icons and colors to differentiate types.

      ```markdown
      !!! success "Available in"
          - [:fontawesome-solid-file-code: Current File focus](../focus/current-file.md)
      ```

    - **Image Integration**: Include images in documentation to enhance understanding. Use lazy loading for performance optimization.

      ```markdown
      ![example-image](./assets/example.png){loading=lazy}
      ```

    - **Code Blocks**: Use fenced code blocks for syntax highlighting and clarity. Ensure code snippets are relevant and concise.

      ```python
      def example_function(param1, param2):
          """Example function with parameters."""
          return param1 + param2
      ```

    ## Python Scripting

    - **Error Handling**: Implement try-except blocks to handle exceptions gracefully. Log errors for debugging purposes.

      ```python
      try:
          with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
              content = file.read()
      except FileNotFoundError as e:
          print(f"Error: {e}")
      ```

    - **Path Management**: Use `pathlib` for file and directory operations to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

      ```python
      from pathlib import Path

      docs_path = Path(__file__).parent / "docs"
      ```

    ## GitHub Actions

    - **Workflow Configuration**: Define clear and concise workflows in `.yml` files. Use environment variables and secrets for sensitive information.

      ```yaml
      jobs:
        build:
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v2
            - name: Set up Python
              uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      ```

    - **Branch Management**: Use descriptive branch names for feature development and bug fixes. Automate pull request creation and notifications.

      ```yaml
      - name: Create pull request
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      ```

    ## Chat Commands

    - **Command Usage**: Use chat commands to automate repetitive tasks such as generating commit messages or describing changesets.

      ```markdown
      ### Command:
      `/commit`
      ```

    - **Focus Selection**: Select appropriate focus modes (e.g., Current File, Git-Diff) to tailor command responses to the relevant context.

      ```markdown
      - **Select Your Focus**: Choose between Current File or Git-Diff for contextually relevant responses.
      ```

    ## Test Generation

    - **Behavior Analysis**: Leverage behavior analysis to identify and categorize test scenarios. Use the advanced panel for managing test generation.

      ```markdown
      ## Behavior Categories
      - **Happy Path**: Ideal and expected use cases.
      - **Edge Case**: Unusual or extreme scenarios.
      ```

    - **Test Refinement**: Continuously refine and customize generated tests to align with project requirements. Use example tests to guide style and consistency.

      ```markdown
      ## Refining Your Tests
      - **Manual Editing**: Directly edit test code for quick adjustments.
      ```

    ## CSS Customization

    - **Custom Styles**: Define custom CSS rules for branding and visual consistency. Use CSS variables for easy theme adjustments.

      ```css
      :root {
          --md-primary-fg-color: #765bfa;
      }
      ```

    - **Responsive Design**: Ensure styles are responsive and adapt to different screen sizes. Use grid layouts for flexible content arrangement.

      ```css
      .md-typeset .grid {
          grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(10rem, 1fr));
      }
      ```

    By adhering to these best practices, you can maintain a consistent and high-quality codebase that is easy to understand, extend, and maintain.
