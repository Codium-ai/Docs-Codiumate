# `/explain`

<h2>Description</h2>

The `/explain` command is designed to provide detailed explanations and insights of your codebase. It is useful for understanding complex or unfamiliar code, identifying potential issues, and gaining a deeper understanding of the logic behind your project. This includes a detailed description of the selected code, inputs and outputs, code flow, and examples of usage. 

<h2>How to Use</h2>
Follow these steps to leverage the `/explain` command effectively:

1. **Select File Mode**: The `/explain` command is exclusively available in File Mode, focusing on providing detailed explanations for specific code segments within a single file.

2. **Select Your Focus**: Identify the piece of code you need elucidation on. This selection ensures that Codiumate tailors the explanation to the relevant code segment, offering precise and actionable insights.

3. **Initiate the Command**: Type `/explain` into the chat interface after selecting your code. Codiumate will then process the selected segment and generate a structured explanation.

4. **Review the Explanation**: Codiumate provides a comprehensive breakdown of the selected code, covering aspects such as:
    - A general description of what the code does.
    - Inputs and outputs, detailing the data the code segment receives and produces.
    - The code flow, outlining the execution path within the code.
    - Example of usage, showing how the code can be used in real-world scenarios.
