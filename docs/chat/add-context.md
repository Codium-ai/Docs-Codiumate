# Add Context

This feature allows you to enrich the context for your Codiumate interactions by selecting additional code snippets from any file in your project. More context leads to more accurate and relevant responses, tailoring the assistance directly to your coding scenario.

## How to Add More Context

1. **Navigate to the Code**: In your IDE, go to the file that contains the code you want to add as additional context.
2. **Select the Code**: Highlight the specific lines or components that you wish to add.
3. **Add Context**: Right-click on the selected code and choose "Add to Codiumate as context" from the context menu, or use the shortcut:
    - In VSCode: ++ctrl+shift+e++ on Windows, ++cmd+shift+e++ on Mac.
    - In JetBrains: ++ctrl+alt+comma++ on Windows, ++cmd+alt+comma++ on Mac.
4. **Confirm the Addition**: The selected code is added as a tag to the chat panel, visually confirming that your context has been expanded.

## Utilizing Additional Context

Once you've added more context, proceed with choosing your primary focus and calling any command. The additional context is automatically considered by Codiumate, enhancing the precision and relevance of the AI's responses.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Accuracy**: By providing more details about the coding environment, Codiumate can offer more precise solutions and suggestions.
- **Flexibility**: You can add context from different parts of your project, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of your inquiry.
- **Efficiency**: Having a richer context reduces the need for back-and-forth clarification, streamlining your coding and problem-solving process.

Remember, the added context persists through your session, enriching every command you execute afterwards with a deeper understanding of your project's structure and logic. You can remove it by clicking the X button on every code snuppet tag.
